### About Me

I'm a junior frontend developer and want to grow in IT. I enjoy writing clean code, creating user-friendly interfaces, and learning new things. I don’t have work experience yet, but I’ve built several study projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
I try to pay attention to details and I'm not afraid to try new things. My goal is to gain experience, work on real tasks, and grow in a team.

### Skills

- Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- Frameworks/Libraries: React, Bootstrap
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Development Tools: VS Code, Figma (basic)

### Code Examples

function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```
